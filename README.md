#### About Me

I am a software engineer. I currently work in the private sector, but I spent about a decade working in the public research space at the intersection of high-performance computing (HPC) and big data analytics. Spent a lot of time thinking about computational linear algebra, GPGPU, and open source software development.

I sometimes post my thoughts to the [fml blog](https://fml-fam.github.io/blog/). I am one of the main developers of the [pbdR project](https://pbdr.org/) for integrating the R language in HPC environments. I also built and maintain the [HPCRAN](https://hpcran.org/), which is an R package repository for HPC packages.
